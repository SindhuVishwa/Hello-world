AWS load balancers:
  Internet Facing 
  Internal only

ELB constantly do the health checks.
diff. AWS availabilty zones

DNS name will be given to ELB.
CNAME alias to resolve the DNS names.

Benefits of ELB
Highly available
Secure - SSL support, user auth
Elasticity - its managed service.
supports hybrid cloud.

Load balancing type:
1. Application Load Balancer - Layer 7 load balancing -  optimized for HTTP and HTTPS
  Server Name Indication (SNI) - single listener for multiple domain, -> handled diff. SSL for diff domains
  IP address as targets
  Lambda functions as targets
  Host/path-based routing
  Containerized application support
  Sticky sessions
  Security - user auth and WAF
  
2.Network Load Balancers
  Layer 4 load balancing - TCP traffic
  Supports millions req/sec
  Preserve source IP
  High throughput/low latency
  Static and Elastic support
  
3. Classic Load Balancers - legacy EC2 - classic network
   not recommended for VPC
   SSL offloading
   Sticky session
   High availability
   Layer 4 and Layer 7 of OSI model
   
ELB is regional service
   Working with multiple AZ in single regional/  for multiple region , use Route 53 load balancing
   Cross zone load balancing - required in application load balancers
   Load balancing nodes - amazon VPC - managed by AWS.
   
 Application Load Balancers
 
 ALB -> Listeners -> Target groups
 Listener -> Rules likes HTTP 8080 -> Target group 1
  Listener -> Rules likes HTTPS 443 -> Target group 3
  Target/Host conditions, Path conditions
  Host based routing -> supports for multiple domains using single load balancer
  Path based routing -> enables supports for microservices
  Integration with Amazon ECS supportd registering tasks with target groups

Network Load balancers  
  NLB ->   TCP based 
  Elastic IP 2 - > AZ1
  Elsatic IP 2 - > AZ 2
  in AZ- > choose Elastic IP address'
  ALB - > Cross zone is enabled by default. But not in NLB

Classic Load balancer
  Legacy model
  
Route 53 -> Records sets -> DNS ->  Routing Policy -> weighted,simple
Route 53 - > gives ability health checks
